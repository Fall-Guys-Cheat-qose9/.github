## 🚫 Warning: Use At Your Own Risk

Let’s keep it real: **cheating in Fall Guys WILL get you banned** eventually. Epic Games runs Easy Anti-Cheat and they’re not playing around. There’s also a chance of malware if you grab random files from sketchy websites. Always scan your files, and never run this stuff on your main account.

If you’re gonna be bold, be smart – alt account, VPN, and backup plans always.

But remember: with great hacks comes great ban potential. So use it wisely, or just for laughs on throwaway accounts.
